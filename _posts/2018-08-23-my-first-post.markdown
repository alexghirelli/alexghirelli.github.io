Today I want to open my own blog and here's the first post that will be the starting point of a great little story.
What will I write in this space? Well it will be a bit of a stream of consciousness, so you can read about everything, I will commit myself to write in a systematic way short articles and reflections on the tech world, on the world of coding and occasionally some of my personal reflection as it were a sort of "diary".
<br/><br/>
In the hope of being able to capture your attention for a few minutes, I wish you a good reading.
